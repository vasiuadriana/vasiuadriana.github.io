<h1>About this Blog</h1>
<p>The motivation behind Mooses Love Forest blog is that writing when everything around you is in a rush means stopping and observing,
    enjoying the world, loving the environment around you.</p>

<p>The more you see and enjoy, the more you have the means to create. And the more you create, the more you want to share.
    Writing is a beautiful way to share - it's permanent and asynchronous!</p>
