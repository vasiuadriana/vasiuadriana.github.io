<h1>Easter break in Sweden</h1>
<p>27 April 2019</p>
<p>I decided that this year I am going to spend the Easter break in Sweden. I wasn't expecting good weather on the east coast 
but Sweden is beautiful even in bad weather so I started my travels with warm clothes and full of hope. 
I was looking forward to get away from London because lately I always seem to be in search for more space and more natural beauty!
Where best to find these than in Sweden? It was the right decision - this break turned out to be pretty much perfect! 
Actually, I am still in Sweden now - a few days after Easter, working from here, and weather has been superb! 
Who says that you should go to Southern Europe to get a tan in the spring? I wish only I packed my sun cream instead of 
extra underlay clothes! It will pain me a bit to head back to London, this place is far too dreamy. I can never get 
tired of feeling the calmness of the Baltic sea!</p>
<h4>So what should you know before an Easter break in Sweden?</h4>
<p>I like traditions and I do appreciate a family celebration! 
And this year I got to be part of a Swedish family Easter celebration! In case you get an invitation yourself, 
here is what you need to know!  </p>
<h5>Be prepared to decorate!</h5>
<p>In Sweden is not only about getting together with food and drinks to share stories. There is something about the spirit of 
the celebrations. And each detail can help create the atmosphere. A funny hen figurine, some painted eggs, some beautiful wild flowers. 
The main Swedish Easter decoration is birch twigs with beautifully coloured feathers! And it can be seen everywhere, and in all sizes. 
Some houses go as far as decorating entire trees!</p>

<h5>Be prepared to eat great food!</h5>
<p>Everyone brings something and everything is just delicious. I don't know if it's the fresh ingredients, 
the simplicity of the combinations or the look of the beautifully arranged platters, but the Swedish food agrees with me!
We had traditional food like sill (pickled herring), korv (sausage) and Jansson's frestelse (creamy potato and anchovy casserole)
but also various salads and cheeses. I like the smörgåsboard style of serving food.
Is practical and makes it easy for the host to enjoy as well. 
I always dread catering for more than 10 people in the same time, I end up spending most of the time in the kitchen or running up and down with plates!</p>
<h5>Be prepared for games!</h5>
<p>My favourite part of the Swedish celebrations is playing games in the outdoors. It's not only an Easter tradition, the games are
part of the Midsommar get together as well. They are called "Femkamp" which would translate to pentathlon but for Easter is a fun and modern take on it. 
For me this competition is a real celebration of the outdoors, good weather and free time! What better way to connect with people 
than fun games? Especially when everyone is involved. We had participants from 4 to 90 years old and everyone got engaged 
in rolling eggs on tilted boards or throwing cheese balls on someone wearing a shower cap topped with whip cream! 
Smiles and laughter all around! In fact, what better way to celebrate anything than to connect with your friends and family!</p>
<h5>Be prepared to see a moose in the wild!</h5>
<p>This one is not really Easter specific. And apparently is quite rare to see a moose in the wild because they are shy 
and spend most of their time deep in the forests. I wanted to see one in their natural habitat for years now and until a few days ago it never happened.
One evening, when coming back from Öregrund, I saw a huge moose just metres away from the road. 
Just pay extra attention between dusk and dawn - that's when it's most likely to spot a moose on the loose!</p>
