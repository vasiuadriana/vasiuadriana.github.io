<h1>Looking for a Place and Discovering a Feeling</h1>
<p>8 November 2018</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much time we are spending trying to find and make a home. I spent about half of my life away from the place I used to call home and 
I feel like I consumed so much of my energy and time being on a quest to find another home!
For many of us the importance of this place makes us move, work harder, take big and calculated decisions. 
We just want to find that place that represents the beginning and the end of each journey we make!</p>
<p>Strange decision to move to London I would say if you are looking for a home but I have done it anyway. 
London is the city of landlords that couldn’t care less about the people that knock on their door. 
The demand for a place is so high that it affects directly and dramatically the quality of any living space. 
Homes are small, poorly maintained but expensive. Is quite difficult to find a place when you have 10 minutes to see it, 
making room for the next batch of people that come to visit behind you, eager to put an offer on it. 
Competition is something that you encounter on all levels in London! 
The bottom line is: if you don’t want the place someone else will have it and even if you want it someone almost always will pay more for it!
After I have been through a few of these situations I told myself that finding a place called home it’s harder than I thought it was. </p>
<p>But London is the place that absorbs you and 2 years become very quickly 4 and before you know it you have spent here almost a decade. 
That happened to me! And lots of wonderful things came and passed: jobs and novelty and good food mixed with tiny flats and scary, crowded commuter trains. 
But until recently I struggled to find the "home". Everyone around me seems to come and go somewhere, and almost no one seems to be from "around here". 
But I was determined that even if my stay in London was temporary I wanted to feel like home! </p>
<p>And I stopped looking for a specific place with specific requirements all together. I pursued the one thing that would make me feel at home - I
embraced the randomness and beauty around me. A few days ago I was walking in the early morning through Bushy park just when the first frost was melting 
in the sun and a soft white fog was raising like a fluffy blanket just enough so you could be surprised by the deers that raised their head and looked 
at you even more surprised! 
You couldn't see the tree trunks so it looked like all the trees were floating. The landscape was effortlessly beautiful! 
Every now and then this happens to me - the beautiful places and things in and around London just sneak up on me. They make me forget about the rush, 
the noise, the buzz of the busy life. 
In that moment in Bushy park I said to myself: "this is it, this is home!". It has a bit, and sometimes a lot, of everything! I am 1 hour away from the Soho madness and in
the middle of a quiet oasis where trees float in the morning sun. It's home because wherever I am going to move I am going to miss this place
and exaggerate it's beauty with melancholy!</p>

<p>London makes me angry and happy in the same time! I seem to like these mixed feelings, no wonder one of my favourite movies is "Life is beautiful"
which made me cry and laugh in the same time. 
London surprises me more than any other place in the world!
Some mornings in the train you feel like absolutely no one sees you and everyone is grumpy but it only takes one small thing out of the ordinary for 
the dynamic to change. For example one morning a dove got in the train through the doors, like a regular passenger and every single person in the carriage 
got animated and smiled and pulled their big headphones off to somehow greet the unexpected event. 
A smile is always greeted with a smile, regardless how uncomfortable the journey is. 
And if you are unwell, like it happened to me once, strangers show you kindness. 
Those are the beautiful things that make a home!</p>
<p>In the end is all about how I feel not about where I am! And I know that I will find more homes in more places, wherever life will take me! </p>
